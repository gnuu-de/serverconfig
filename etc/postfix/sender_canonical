# The sender_canonical_maps parameter specifies optional address
# mapping lookup tables for envelope and header SENDER addresses.
#
# For example, you want to rewrite the SENDER address user@ugly.domain
# to user@pretty.domain, while still being able to send mail to the
# RECIPIENT address user@ugly.domain.
# See man 5 canonical,  /etc/postfix/canonical or
# /etc/postfix/sample-canonical.cf for more details
